# google-homepage
Odin-project-1

This is the first project in the Odin Projects Web Development course. The goal of this project was to clone the Google homepage as close as possible using only their site as reference (no peaking at their HTML/CSS.) 

This seemed easy at first, but I quickly learned how finicky CSS and the box model can be. I learned the differences between padding, margin, border and how that all wraps around the content.

I also ended up downloading a color picker extension for chrome, which turned out to be very helpful in getting the styling as close as I could to Googles. 

What I struggled the most with, was how difficult it can be to get elements EXACTLY where they need to be, and how every action you take effects other elements. 

I had a lot of fun with this project however, and look forward to working with CSS more.
